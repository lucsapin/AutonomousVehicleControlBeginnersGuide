# Luc Sapin improvements list

1. Explore the ekf simulation diversity (multiple sensors, obstacle list, ...)
2. Study the possibility to add multiple lidar sensors in a vehicle (short range, long range, ...)
3. Study the possibility of installing the GNSS observations (antenna positionning) --> need an 'install' method in the GNSS object.
4. Study the possibility of error models in the GNSS observations
5. Study the possibility of tunnel-like environments in the obstacle construction.
